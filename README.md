Fog AI Mesh routing DB
Running A Fog to DTN mesh b-lan network we do Fog AI on whatever computers are available on our mobile network.
Back ground Routing AI requests within our FOG network requires that we create a Reinforcement Learning Based Load Balancing Algorithm.
The proposed process allows Fog nodes to offload an optimal number of tasks among incoming tasks by selecting an available neighboring Fog node under their respective resource capabilities with the aim to minimize the processing time and the overall overloading probability. See The Paper below.
